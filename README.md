# üöÄ SentinelAI ‚Äì Real Time Threat and Emergency Detection System

---

## üìù Overview
SentinelAI is an advanced, real-time emergency detection system that integrates multiple deep learning models to detect and alert emergency scenarios. It combines:
- **Fire Detection** (CNN-based)
- **Shoplifting Detection** (3D-CNN based)
- **Accident Detection** (CNN/LSTM-based)
- Existing **Theft, Assault, Road Incidents, Fire/Smoke** modules

The system uses computer vision and deep learning to process CCTV or live video feeds, identifying critical events and triggering alerts for rapid response.

## ‚ú® Highlights
- **Multi-Event Detection:** Fire, theft, assault, road accidents, shoplifting, and more.  
- **Real-Time Monitoring & Alerts:** Immediate notifications to the appropriate emergency services.  
- **Efficient & Lightweight:** Modular design deployable on edge devices and cloud.

### Shoplifting Detection ‚Äì 3D-CNN (SlowFast Inspired)
![3D-CNN](https://github.com/TanishLal/SentinalAi/blob/main/DB_Sample/input/Convolution%20Neural%20Network%20(CNN).png)  
**Description:** Splits input video into Fast and Slow paths. RGB and Optical Flow streams capture motion and semantics. Features are fused for final classification.

### Fire Detection ‚Äì CNN
![CNN](https://github.com/TanishLal/SentinalAi/blob/main/DB_Sample/input/Long%20Short%20Term%20Memory%20(LSTM).png)  
**Description:** Lightweight CNN variants (FireNet, Inception-OnFire) optimized for real-time fire/smoke detection.

### Accident Detection ‚Äì CNN + LSTM
![CNN-LSTM](https://github.com/TanishLal/SentinelAI/blob/702b6e85099cf036532792067d654fc79882bd22/521_2020_4867_Fig1_HTML.png)
**Description:** Combines spatial CNN layers and temporal LSTM units for accurate accident recognition.

## üîî Real-Time Alarming & Notification System

**This module ensures that each detected event triggers an immediate, automated response with location details:**

### üî• Fire Accidents
- Detects fire or smoke using CCTV feeds.  
- Sends **instant alerts to the nearest fire brigade**.  
- Shares **location of the CCTV camera** where the incident occurred.  
- Optionally triggers **voice calls/SMS** to emergency contacts.

### üöë Road Accidents
- Detects accidents from traffic or road cameras.  
- Notifies the **nearest hospital** and **emergency response team**.  
- **Calls an ambulance automatically** with the CCTV location.  
- Provides a short **video clip or snapshot** of the incident.

### ü•∑ Shoplifting
- Detects theft or suspicious activity in retail environments.  
- Sends **real-time notifications to the store owner/manager** through:  
   - **Web dashboard alert**  
   - **SMS/WhatsApp message**  
   - **Optional phone call alert**  
- Includes **image snapshot and timestamp**.
